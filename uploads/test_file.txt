This is a test file for Hybrid ECC-AES192 encryption system.
It contains multiple lines of text to demonstrate the encryption and decryption capabilities.
The system should be able to encrypt this file and then decrypt it back to the original content.

Testing features:
1. ECC key generation
2. ECDH key exchange
3. HKDF key derivation
4. AES-192 encryption
5. AES-192 decryption
6. Performance monitoring

Line 1: Hello World!
Line 2: Testing encryption...
Line 3: Hybrid cryptography system
Line 4: AES-192 with ECC
Line 5: Secure file transfer

End of test file.
